# Reanalysis, Replication, Variability of [ERP Core](https://erpinfo.org/erp-core) N170, N2pc and P3

This repository contains the code for the reananlysis of the ERP core components N170, N2pc and P3. This analysis allows extracting effect sizes and variability measures from the ERP components to compute a priori power analyses. Susbsequently, new data collection has been planned and conducted to replicate the original findings and to test the variability of the ERP components, testing for hardware and site effects.

## Reanalysis

The code is written in matab and uses EEGLAB and LIMO MEEG. The script `ERPcore-ElectroTools_analysis.m` imnport, preprocess and do the statistical analysis of the N170, N2pc and P3 components. 

## Replication
